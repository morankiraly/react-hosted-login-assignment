Hi There,

Integration Experience:
1. Got mixed up with all the guides and links. 
-- Documentation flow
-- github repository
-- links to the docs from inside the dashboard
-- some of the code snippests are duplicated in a few places.

When following the guide and copy the code examples, I couldnt compile the code and got many errors.
I wasnt able to integrate (even with my dorrect domain this time:)) 
Finally I decided to delete everything and intsall my own react app with using the guide,
copied only spesific lines from the examples and it worked like a charm.
I have a reason to believe that repository is not updated and the code tehre is broken.

Login & dashboard
1. I'v noticed that the submit button in the login screen is missing a user expeirience functionality.
It seems enabled and it is clickable, before entering the email input.
When clicking on it, I get no error or message that the email input is missing.
Than I found the way to costomize it via login box, but unfortunatlly the preview did not indicate
the changes while playing with its state.

2. I didnt see any section of managing errors.
-- Do I want to notify my user when something in wrong?
-- Do I want to edit the errors myself?
-- Do I want to give a field description, or tooltip about somthing or maybe I want to disable it?


3. while I was searching my way in the portal, I found a broken QR code under setting up an authenticator app:
Admin portal >> privacy & policy >> MFA.


4. I have a way to navigate from the portal to the builder, but no navigation button to my home portal 
although its the same base app: https://portal.frontegg.com/builder/app-experience/login-box
the user needs to adit the url or go back by using the browser navigation.

5. Privacy policy and T&C - In order to be enbaled and presented, it requires a mandatory link.
if the link is not provided, to toggle stil shows this capability is enabled. the user might be confused 
to enable this cabality although it wont work.

6. Personal token is not generated correctly, seems no request is sent out when clicking on the generate btn.
7. API token is generated successfully, I'v noticed that the 'Created By' column is showing 'Unknown' user
although this information can easily identified.

7. UX is exstremely easy and helpfull when every capability is toggled up.

Cypress - 
In those two days I learned tons about cypress.
My tests are pretty basic but already have ideas for many flows.
I really wanted to give you the experience of POM but had diffeclties but passing a function
in cy.origin() and I need to go deep and understand teh exact workarounds exists.

Coundlt find a way to decent way to debug except actually put a debugger in my code. 
it would of gone faster once I get the idea. 
Already read about planty of ways to best practice, so igur to start.

Thank You
